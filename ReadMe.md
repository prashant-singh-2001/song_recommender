## Song Recommender

This project is a song recommender application that allows users to search for songs and receive recommendations based on their selections.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Potentially React, Vue.js, or another front-end framework. (Specific framework can be confirmed by checking the `frontend` directory)
- **Backend:** Python (Likely using libraries like Flask or Django)
- **Deployment:** Docker

### Usage

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker installed: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/song_recommender.git
   ```

   (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd song_recommender
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   This script builds the Docker images (if needed) and starts all the application services defined in `docker-compose.yaml`.

4. Access the application:

   The application is likely accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` depends on how the ports are mapped in `docker-compose.yaml`. Typically, the front-end service might be exposed on port 3000, so you could try `http://localhost:3000`.

**Using the Application:**

(The specific way users interact with the application will depend on the front-end implementation. You can explore the application interface after starting it as instructed above.)

- The application likely allows you to search for songs by name or artist.
- Based on your search, the application will recommend similar songs.

**Note:**

This is a generic guide assuming a standard setup for this project structure. If there are specific configurations or dependencies mentioned in the code (e.g., setting environment variables), you might need to adjust the instructions accordingly.

## Project Structure

This project uses a separation of concerns by dividing the codebase into a backend and frontend:

- **[song_recommender/](song_recommender/)** (Root Directory)
  - **[python_backend/](song_recommender/python_backend/)** (Backend code)
    - **[ml_recommend/](song_recommender/python_backend/ml_recommend/)** (Machine Learning Recommendation logic)
      - **[recommender.ipynb](song_recommender/python_backend/ml_recommend/recommender.ipynb):** Jupyter Notebook file likely containing the core recommendation logic using machine learning models.
      - **[spotify_millsongdata.csv](song_recommender/python_backend/ml_recommend/spotify_millsongdata.csv):** CSV file containing song data (potentially from Spotify or a similar source).
    - **[env/](song_recommender/python_backend/env/)** (Virtual environment directory) - This directory is likely ignored by Git and should not be committed.
    - **[**pycache**/](song_recommender/python_backend/__pycache__/)** (Cache directory) - This directory is automatically generated by Python and should not be committed.
    - **[Dockerfile](song_recommender/python_backend/Dockerfile):** Defines instructions for building a Docker image for the backend.
    - **[tempTestFile.py](song_recommender/python_backend/tempTestFile.py):** (Optional) A temporary test script (consider removing if not actively used).
    - **[requirements.txt](song_recommender/python_backend/requirements.txt):** Text file containing dependency requirements for the backend project.
    - **[main.py](song_recommender/python_backend/main.py):** Likely the main entry point for the backend application.
    - **[data.pkl](song_recommender/python_backend/data.pkl):** (Optional) A pickled data file used by the backend (consider mentioning its contents if relevant).
    - **[Song.py](song_recommender/python_backend/Song.py):** Python class definition for representing song data.
    - **[similarity_dict.pkl](song_recommender/python_backend/similarity_dict.pkl):** (Optional) A pickled dictionary used for storing song similarities (consider mentioning its purpose if relevant).
  - **[frontend/](song_recommender/frontend/)** (Frontend code)
    - **[node_modules/](song_recommender/frontend/node_modules/)** (Dependency directory) - This directory is typically ignored by Git and should not be committed. It's automatically generated by npm/yarn and contains downloaded project dependencies.
    - **[src/](song_recommender/frontend/src/)** (Source code directory)
      - **[index.js](song_recommender/frontend/src/index.js):** Main JavaScript entry point for the frontend application.
      - **[index.css](song_recommender/frontend/src/index.css):** Main CSS stylesheet for the frontend application.
      - **[components/](song_recommender/frontend/src/components/)** (Reusable UI components) - This directory likely contains reusable UI components for building the frontend interface.
      - **[App.js](song_recommender/frontend/src/App.js):** Main React component for the application (assuming React is used).
      - **[App.css](song_recommender/frontend/src/App.css):** CSS styles specific to the App component.
    - **[public/](song_recommender/frontend/public/)** (Public assets directory)
      - **[robots.txt](song_recommender/frontend/public/robots.txt):** File instructing search engines how to crawl the website.
      - **[manifest.json](song_recommender/frontend/public/manifest.json):** (Optional) Manifest file for web applications or Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).
      - **[logo512.png](song_recommender/frontend/public/logo512.png)** & **[logo192.png](song_recommender/frontend/public/logo192.png):** App icons in different sizes.
      - **[index.html](song_recommender/frontend/public/index.html):** Main HTML file for the frontend application.
      - **[favicon.ico](song_recommender/frontend/public/favicon.ico):** Favicon for the website.
    - **[tailwind.config.js](song_recommender/frontend/tailwind.config.js):** Configuration file for Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework (if used in the project).
    - **[package-lock.json](song_recommender/frontend/package-lock.json):** Lock file generated by npm/yarn to ensure consistent dependency versions.
