## Song Recommender

This project is a song recommender application that allows users to search for songs and receive recommendations based on their selections.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Potentially React, Vue.js, or another front-end framework. (Specific framework can be confirmed by checking the `frontend` directory)
- **Backend:** Python (Likely using libraries like Flask or Django)
- **Deployment:** Docker

### Usage

**Prerequisites:**

- Docker installed: [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

**Instructions:**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/song_recommender.git
   ```

   (Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username)

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd song_recommender
   ```

3. Start the application:

   ```bash
   ./start.sh
   ```

   This script builds the Docker images (if needed) and starts all the application services defined in `docker-compose.yaml`.

4. Access the application:

   The application is likely accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` depends on how the ports are mapped in `docker-compose.yaml`. Typically, the front-end service might be exposed on port 3000, so you could try `http://localhost:3000`.

**Using the Application:**

(The specific way users interact with the application will depend on the front-end implementation. You can explore the application interface after starting it as instructed above.)

- The application likely allows you to search for songs by name or artist.
- Based on your search, the application will recommend similar songs.

**Note:**

This is a generic guide assuming a standard setup for this project structure. If there are specific configurations or dependencies mentioned in the code (e.g., setting environment variables), you might need to adjust the instructions accordingly.
